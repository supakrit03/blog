### Intro

I have a project written in AngularJS that was transferred to my team and this is the most legacy frontend technology I have seen in my company. The codebase mixed between typescipts and javascript, most dependencies using in this project are deprecated and some of it no longer exist on npm.

In project use “any” type In many places which is difficult to know what type of parameter is while trailing code. So lucky for my team, we will not implement any feature on top of it or if we would we will initital a new project with React or Angular instead.

### What is AngularJS

AngularJS, also referred to as Angular 1.x, is an open-source JavaScript frameworks developed by Google for building single-page web applications. It was popular tool and now it’s deprecated.

### AngularJS in 2025

Should NOT use AngularJS for any new web development projects. Choose a modern framework like Angular (2+), React, or Vue.js instead.

If you are working with an existing AngularJS project , understand that it's a legacy application with increasing security and maintenance risks. Your team's long-term strategy should involve planning and executing a migration to a modern framework.
